                <p> The HEIF app is designed to facilitate the user's weight loss journey by providing a personalized and flexible plan. The app includes features such as meal recommendations, exercise tracking, and activity monitoring</p>
                <h3> Problem </h3>
                <p>As a project in Ironhack bootcamp, wee were told to find and design solution for The Daily Health Conference, it is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting health and wellness. It offers an online membership on their website. Even though The Daily Health Conference has numerous years of experience in the field, its program has been slow to catch up with technology. They have seen a substantial drop in memberships.
                Now the Daily Health Conference wants to find a way to offer more value to its members.</p>

                <p>
                    To gather valuable insights and understand the needs of potential users, we initiated the research phase by conducting an online survey using Google Forms. The survey was designed to capture relevant data and identify any recurring patterns or insights. We received a total of 127 responses, which provided us with a substantial dataset to analyze and draw meaningful conclusions. This quantitative research approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the problem at hand and provided valuable input for the subsequent design and development stages.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the online survey, we conducted individual interviews with five individuals over Zoom who expressed their desire to lose weight. The interviews aimed to gain deeper insights into the challenges they face and understand their experiences related to weight loss. Below are some of the questions asked during the interviews:
                    </p>
                        <p>How do you currently feel about your overall health and fitness level?</p>

                        <p>Can you tell me about your previous experiences with weight loss? </p>
                        <p>What types of physical activity or exercise do you currently engage in?  </p>
                        <p>How do you typically track your food intake and exercise routines?</p>
                        <p>What are some challenges or obstacles you anticipate encountering during your weight loss journey?

                <p> As part of the process of defining the HIEF app, user personas are created to represent the target audience and their specific needs. One such persona is Mohammed, a final-year undergraduate student who is currently facing weight gain due to his heavy reliance on fast food for meals. Mohammed, who lives away from his family, finds it challenging to maintain a healthy eating routine, resulting in a loss of confidence and a desire to regain control over his weight. With his unique circumstances and goals in mind, Mohammed serves as a representative of individuals seeking a solution that can accommodate their busy student lifestyles while providing guidance and support in making healthier food choices.</p>

                <p> After completing the research phase, the next step was to narrow down the essential needs and create a plan for the eventual features to be developed. Using the MoSCoW method, we have determined the main value proposition for the HIEF app, which is as follows:

                    The primary goal of the application is to assist individuals who want to lose weight in a healthy and flexible manner, tailored to their specific goals. The app will provide users with a personalized plan consisting of exercises and meals that align with their weight loss objectives. Additionally, the app will monitor the user's performance as they follow the plan, offering motivation and support along the way. Furthermore, the app will provide users with healthy alternatives for exercises and meals, ensuring that they have a variety of options to choose from.</p>

        <p> To bring our ideas to life and visualize the app's design, we began by sketching low-fidelity wireframes. These wireframes served as a rough layout of the app's screens and functionality. Once the wireframes were created, we proceeded to develop a prototype based on these initial designs.

            To ensure that our ideas were effective and user-friendly, we conducted user testing with five individuals. The purpose of this testing was to gather feedback and insights from potential users, allowing us to identify areas for improvement and refine our ideas.</p>

        <p> After sketching our ideas, we translated them into mid-fidelity wireframes, which provided a more detailed representation of the app's interface and layout. Once the mid-fidelity wireframes were ready, we proceeded to create a prototype based on these designs. The prototype simulated the app's functionality, allowing users to interact with it as if it were a fully functional application.
            
            To gather feedback and validate our design decisions, we conducted usability testing with five individuals. These users interacted with the prototype, and we observed their actions and collected their feedback. The testing aimed to identify any usability issues, gather insights on user preferences, and uncover areas for improvement.</p>
